// Hey there, the index.html file was built on an html5 boilerplate template, and the css is based on Andy Taylor's 1140px scalable grid. The main purpose of this is to make a scalable layout that has more than one response to changes / differing browser sizes. It's built in terms of "breaks" or thresholds in which the current css breaks and a media query changes the css. Play around, fork, make it better, and wait for the new CSS specs like flex-box!
